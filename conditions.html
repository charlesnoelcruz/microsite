                time from the date the payment for Verification is received by Service Seeking.
            </p>
            <p>
                Service Seeking may use any appropriate icons, images or text on the business
                profile and in quotes submitted by a verified business to differentiate them from
                a business user who has not been verified. Service Seeking may modify the icons,
